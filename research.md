## Research Overview

My research focuses on strong-field gravity and spacetime singularities,
with particular emphasis on gravitational collapse and its observational
signatures.

### Core Themes
- Cosmic Censorship and Naked Singularities
- Gravitational Collapse
- Gravitational Waves from Strong Gravity
- Galaxy Quenching and Large-Scale Effects
