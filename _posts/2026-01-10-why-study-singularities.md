title: "Why Study Singularities?"

    Singularities are not just mathematical curiosities. They may encode the deepest connection
    between gravity and quantum physics.

## The problem
In General Relativity, a singularity is a region where the classical description of spacetime breaks down.
A famous question is whether such regions are always hidden behind horizons (**cosmic censorship**).

## A simple equation
The Einstein field equations:
$$
G_{\mu\nu} = 8\pi T_{\mu\nu}
$$

## Why it matters
If naked singularities exist, they could produce observational signatures distinct from black holes:
- different gravitational wave features
- different lensing / shadow structures
- different orbital precession

I’ll build intuition step-by-step in future posts.
