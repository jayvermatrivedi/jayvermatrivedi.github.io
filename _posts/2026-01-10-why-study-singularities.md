Recently, this image gained widespread popularity within moments of its release by the Event Horizon Telescope group (EHT group) on May 12, 2022. Depicting the center of our galaxy, the Milky Way, the EHT group propelled it to fame with the headline "Astronomers Reveal First Image of the Black Hole at the Heart of Our Galaxy." However, those immersed in the field of astrophysics are well aware of the nuances associated with this title. Firstly, labelling it as at the "heart" of our galaxy raises a playful eyebrow, as conventionally the heart is situated slightly to the left of the body, not at the centre, pun intended. Secondly, a technical concern arises in designating this celestial object as a "black hole".

The Nobel Prize organizing committee also made a similar mistake while awarding the Nobel Prize in physics to Roger Penrose from the University of Oxford in 2020. Their citation read, "for the discovery that black hole formation is a robust prediction of the general theory of relativity", as the prize motivation. The correct statement will use the word "singularity" instead of "black hole." Let us delve into the source and rationale behind the disagreements within the astrophysics community. Additionally, we will explore here the significance of two widely used yet somewhat intricate terms in astrophysics: "black hole" and "singularity."

In delving into theoretical aspects of astrophysics, it is crucial to harken back to Einstein's brilliance. At rather large mass scales, such as those of stars and galaxies, the pertinent framework for understanding gravity is Einstein's theory of general relativity. In essence, this theory articulates how the presence of mass or energy curves the fabric of space-time, and in turn, this curvature governs the dynamics of objects and particles within this curved space-time. The resolution to our doubts lies within the domain that has emerged from the theory of general relativity: the 'gravitational collapse' of massive stars in the universe.

Massive stars in the universe undergo a collapse or shrinkage due to their own gravity when they run out the nuclear fuel within. Depleted of the fuel that sustained it over millions of years, the star succumbs to the inability to support its own gravity, initiating its catastrophic collapse. Even modest stars, like our sun, undergo a phase of collapse but eventually stabilize at a reduced size. In contrast, for a sufficiently massive star, gravity dominates all opposing forces, preventing any cessation of the collapse. Transitioning from a span of millions of kilometers across, the star compresses into a minuscule point, smaller than the dot at the end of this sentence. Many scientists believe the outcome is a black hole, a celestial object with incredibly strong gravity that traps everything nearby. A black hole consists of two main parts. The center is a singularity, an incredibly tiny point where all the star's material is squeezed. Around the singularity is a space area where nothing can break free, and this boundary is known as the event horizon. Once something crosses this boundary, it is stuck and cannot escape. Even the light emitted by the falling object is captured, making it invisible to observers outside this boundary. Eventually, everything plunges into the singularity.

But is this description accurate? The laws of physics tell us that a singularity forms, but they are unclear about the event horizon. Penrose demonstrated that the creation of a singularity is inevitable under specific conditions in the theory of general relativity. However, he has not proven that the resulting singularity will always be concealed by the event horizon. Many scientists assume that a horizon must form, partly because it is a convenient scientific concept. The real mystery lies at the singularity - when matter gets squished, what happens next? The event horizon acts like a shield, keeping the singularity hidden and maintaining a gap in our understanding. Strange things might be going on at the singularity, but they do not affect the outside world. Astronomers studying the paths of planets and stars can confidently apply the usual laws of physics, ignoring the uncertainties associated with singularities. Anything that occurs inside a black hole stays inside.

However, research in past decades has challenged this common assumption. Scientists have identified various scenarios of stellar collapse where an event horizon might not form, leaving the singularity exposed. They call it a "naked singularity." Both matter and radiation can go in and come out. While journeying to the singularity within a black hole would be a one-way trip, theoretically, you could get as close as you want to a naked singularity and return to share the experience.

There are various types of naked singularities. First, there is the momentary naked singularity, where the singularity becomes visible briefly when the event horizon first forms. Then, there is the evaporating naked singularity, where the singularity forms but quickly loses its entire mass. Another type is the singularity surrounded by matter, where the singularity forms, but the event horizon never appears.

In 2011, Pankaj Joshi and his colleagues provided a detailed analysis of this third kind of naked singularity. They created a model of a galaxy that illustrates how a certain type of matter can collapse into a stable configuration with an ultra-dense core. This model is known as the Joshi-Malafarina-Narayan (JMN) naked singularity. Despite the EHT group popularizing the image at the center of our Milky Way as a black hole, they acknowledged in their papers that the JMN naked singularity is one of the best black hole mimickers. This is because naked singularities can produce images that look just like those of black holes.

Scientists have debated for years whether naked singularities could occur. Penrose ruled them out in 1969, though he formulated a conjecture he called `Cosmic Censorship'. This concept gained prominence in the 1970s and is the primary reason some physicists remain steadfast in believing in the existence of event horizons. Based on this hypothesis, which was subsequently never proved, a lot of physics of black holes developed. However, it turned out that Einstein's gravitational equations are notoriously intricate and admit more possibilities. Due to their complexity, these equations necessitated simplification for practical analysis. In the late 1930s, American physicists J. Robert Oppenheimer and Hartland S. Snyder, along with the independent work of Indian physicist B. Datt, embarked on an initial attempt. Their approach involved considering perfectly spherical stars, assuming they were composed of homogeneously dense gas, and ignoring gas pressure to simplify the equations. Their findings revealed that as this simplified star collapsed, the gravitational force at its surface intensified to the point where it could trap all light and matter, forming a black hole. Consequently, the collapsing star became invisible to external observers and ultimately collapsed entirely into a singularity.

In reality, stars are more complex than early theories allowed. They have uneven density, and the gas inside them exerts pressure. Plus, they do not always have a perfect sphere shape. So, the big question is, does every massive collapsing star become a black hole? As mentioned above, Penrose proposed that the answer is yes. He suggested that when a singularity forms during a star's collapse, it is always accompanied by the formation of an event horizon. This cosmic censorship idea or hypothesis has served as the foundation of our current understanding of black holes. Physicists hoped to prove this conjecture using strong mathematical reasoning, just like they did with the inevitability of singularities.

However, proving it directly for all situations turned out to be trickier than expected. Instead of a clear-cut proof, researchers had to take the longer route of studying different cases of stellar collapse, gradually adding details to their theoretical models. In 1973, physicist Hans Jürgen Seifert and his colleagues considered uneven density. They discovered that layers of falling matter could create temporary singularities not covered by horizons. Yet, these singularities were not that harmful - they did not crush matter into a tiny point. General relativity held up, and matter continued moving through without getting obliterated.

In 1979, Douglas M. Eardley and Larry Smarr conducted a numerical simulation of a star with a more realistic pressureless density profile. They found that the star shrank to zero size, revealing a naked singularity. Another study in 1984 by Demetrios Christodoulou confirmed these findings, but Richard P.A.C. Newman showed that these singularities were gravitationally weak and therefore not genuine ones.

Subsequently, many researchers tried to create a solid theorem stating that naked singularities would always be weak. Unfortunately or fortunately, they could not do it because models were discovered where naked singularities have, in fact, strong curvature properties. They discovered scenarios in which collapsing stars formed strong singularities that could crush matter, yet these remained visible to outside observers. A detailed and complete analysis of stellar collapse without gas pressure, developed in 1993 by Indresh Dwivedi and Pankaj Joshi, clarified and settled these points comprehensively.

In the early 1990s, scientists began studying the impact of gas pressure on the collapse of stars. Amos Ori and Tsvi Piran conducted computer simulations, and Joshi's team solved the relevant equations analytically. They found that, given realistic relationships between density and pressure, stars could collapse into naked singularities. Around the same time, teams led by Giulio Magli and Ken-ichi Nakao explored the pressure generated by particle rotation within collapsing stars and also showed that collapse often leads to naked singularities.

These studies focused on perfectly round stars, which is not too limiting, since most stars in nature are very close to spherical. Moreover, spherical stars actually provide more favorable conditions for the formation of an event horizon. So, as Roy Kerr pointed out to Pankaj Joshi, if cosmic censorship fails even for spherical stars, its credibility is in question. However, scientists have also been looking into the collapse of stars that are not perfectly spherical. In 1991, Stuart L. Shapiro and Saul A. Teukolsky attempted simulations where oblong stars could collapse into a naked singularity. A few years later, Andrzej Królak and Joshi studied the collapse of non-spherical stars and also found naked singularities.

Skeptics have questioned whether these scenarios are realistic or would occur in nature. Could a small change in the star's initial setup suddenly cause an event horizon to cover the singularity? If that is the case, then the naked singularity might be a result of the approximations used in the calculations and might not actually happen in nature. While some situations involving unusual forms of matter are indeed sensitive, the results so far suggest that most naked singularities remain stable even with small changes to the initial conditions. Therefore, these situations are what physicists call "generic" - they are not artificially created.

These examples that go against Penrose's idea show that cosmic censorship is not a strict rule. Physicists cannot confidently say, "Every big star collapse turns into a black hole," or "Any collapse we see in real life always becomes a black hole." Some situations end with a black hole, while others result in a naked singularity. In certain models, the singularity is visible only briefly before an event horizon forms, hiding it. In other cases, the singularity stays visible forever. Usually, the naked singularity forms at the very center of the collapse, but this is not always the case. Even when it does, it can also spread to other areas. The degree of nakedness can vary, too: an event horizon might keep the singularity hidden from faraway observers, but those who go through the event horizon could see the singularity before reaching it. The different outcomes can be confusing. However, one thing is certain: A star cannot exclusively conclude its life by becoming a black hole.

As a culmination of these studies, Penrose, in a recent interview with the New Scientist, highlighted a distinction related to his Nobel Prize. He explained, "What the (Nobel) citation said was black holes are a robust prediction of Einstein's general theory of relativity. What I really showed was that singularities are a robust prediction of general relativity. See, the thing that we don't know is whether you get singularities that are hidden behind horizons, which is a black hole, that's what we believe, or whether you could get naked ones. It's the singularities that are just there, and information could emerge from them. And I, in a sort of way, rather hoped in my wild sort of view that maybe naked singularities might occur. But as far as I'm aware, there is still no proof. The general community sort of resigned to the idea is what you get is black holes. Which, in a sense, is the more boring situation." He expressed uncertainty about whether singularities are always hidden behind horizons, forming black holes as commonly believed, or if they could exist as naked singularities, allowing information to escape. In his unique perspective, he expressed a hopeful curiosity about the possibility of naked singularities, although he acknowledged there is still no conclusive proof. While the scientific community tends to lean towards black holes, Penrose's words serve as inspiration, especially for new research students like us who are delving into the field with our initial papers. In Pankaj Joshi's group at the International Centre for Space and Cosmology (ICSC) at Ahmedabad University, my colleagues and I actively explore ways to differentiate naked singularities from black holes observationally. Our aim is to establish a clear distinction and determine which concept is acceptable.

You may be familiar with the concept of the Big Bang, the singularity from which the entire universe and time originated. Well, here is an interesting twist: the Big Bang singularity is, in fact, a naked singularity…
